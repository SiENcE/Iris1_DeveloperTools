IrisEdit v0.95, Copyright (C) 2005^ Iris Team
--------------------------------------------------------------
This Application is the 3D Editor for Iris (UO) 3D-Client.


On first Start, if you haven't specify the UO Files under the Options Menu->Settings (select the right Path to your \tiledata.mul etc.) IrisEdit gives you an Execption. You have to configure the UO-Path and restart IrisEdit.

Doubleclick on a TileID Model to display the 3D Model.

------------------------------------------------------

You can import 3DS files and modify them, to fit into the "outbox". The so called "outbox" represents the 2D Raster for a Tile. You see the referenced 2D Static Object or Ground Tile from your Ultima Online installation at the right side of the Editor.

IrisEdit.imc (from 29.04.2005) includes all 3D Objects with Textures (Statics). You can also specify new UO Groundtextures in IrisEdit's TextureManager (Replace Gorund Textures).

To create a new Models.imc File for Iris, you have to choose "Create Game File..." from the Menu. This needs much time!! To Speed up this process you can choose "Update Game File...".
