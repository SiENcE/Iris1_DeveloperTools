Hello. This is my first shot at building a font. I found a Celtic typestyle in
a book of Celtic art and scanned it. Then I imported it into Corel 3.0 and cleaned
it up to export as a .PFB. It is primarily a drop-cap style and so with out lower-
case letters it appeared quite ineffectual, so, I took the lower case from Celtic,
the .PFB, with FontMonger v 1.07, and incorporated those. I then fudged several keys
into forming the rest of typeface; and VOILA!, CelticMD was created. I have a strong
interest in my Celtic heritage and will be using this font in a national newsletter
relating to Celtic and Scottish history and clann events.

Due to the detail in the drop-caps, I highly recommend employing the caps at 36pts
and greater.

I hope you enjoy CelticMD.
